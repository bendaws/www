            <h1>The Bolt Programming Language</h1>
            <p>
                Lua is an amazing language, but it isn't perfect. Being a compiled language but not
                being able to run standalone executables is a strange concept to make with.
                Bolt is designed to be exactly like Lua with language optimizations that make
                it closer to TypeScript. Here are the main differences:

                <li>
                    Lua is a compiled language with no standalone executables.
                    <br>
                    Bolt is a transpiled language that transpiles to C++, then uses the
                    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gcc">gcc</a> compiler to make an executable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lua does not deal with types outside of <code>type()</code>.
                    <br>
                    Bolt allows for explicit types, but does not force them. If
                    a type is mismatched, it delivers a warning at compile time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lua releases versions of their <b>source</b> every couple years.
                    <br>
                    Bolt puts out a new release every month that can optionally be upgraded automatically
                    with <code>bolt --upgrade</code>.
                </li>
                <br>
                Note that Bolt is not ready for stable use. It's currently reported version is
                <code>BTC version 0.0.2, build 392 (testing)</code>.
            </p>
