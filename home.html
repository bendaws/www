            <p>I am a 14 year old developer who mostly works on C and C++ projects. I also created
                <a href="https://linuxfornoobs.org">linuxfornoobs.org</a>.

        <h2>My Internet History</h2>

        <p>
            I've had a prescence on the Internet since 2015, when I made a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch account</a>. I learned Lua in 2018 before moving to Python,
            C++, C, A little bit of Rust, and I have since then been
            scripting using Bash, C, and C++.
        </p>
        <p>
            My earliest project was a small LFS system that I have since lost to time. It was not a very good
            LFS build, but at least it was one.
        </p>
        <p>
            I currently maintain and update <a href="https://linuxfornoobs.org">linuxfornoobs.org</a>.
            It's designed to make a Linux installation process easy and simple without ads or random information.
        </p>

        <h2>Why is my website in Plain Text?</h2>

        <p>
            This website was built about 8 years ago (2016) when I was new to HTML5 in general. While it was not hosted on
            bendaws.net, it was still a beginner website. Plain text also renders much better across browsers
            compared to difficult CSS patterns. <a href="/css/style.css">You can even check out my CSS file</a>
            to see how basic it is compared to larger, more complete homepages.
        </p>
